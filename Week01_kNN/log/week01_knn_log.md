# Week 01 Log — kNN on Wine

## What I worked on
- Implemented kNN classification on Wine dataset
- Tested k from 1..20 and compared Euclidean vs Manhattan distances
- Saved accuracy curve and confusion matrix

## Key results
- Best k (Euclidean): __
- Final accuracy: __
- Outputs:
  - images/week01_knn_accuracy_vs_k.png
  - images/week01_knn_confusion_matrix.png

## Notes
- StandardScaler used because kNN depends on distance.
